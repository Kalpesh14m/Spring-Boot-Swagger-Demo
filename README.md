## Swagger UI

**Swagger UI** _allows anyone_ :— be it your development team or your end consumers — ***to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place***. It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.
